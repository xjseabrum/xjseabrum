# Quick Introduction
Hello! My name is Jay Seabrum (Xajavion Seabrum) and I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

Here on this GitHub you will find some of the projects that I have done either for class or on my own free time. At the bottom below, you will find links to these projects.  Each of the links will have a README that explains more about the projects contained therein. 

If you have any questions or would like to cite any of the reports found on my GitHub please contact me at:

# Interests
Currently I am most interested in how ML and AI can approach problems that are linguistically rooted.  As such, the projects that I have worked on are mainly geared towards analyzing text data from ML and AI (NNDL) approaches.  However, I am also skilled at using general data science techniques and analyses to approach data and ultimately drive meaning from it.  

# Education
I received my undergraduate degree from Boston University in May 2018.  I double-majored in Economics and in Japanese Language & Literature.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in Computational Linguistics at the University of Colorado Boulder.  My expected graduation date is May 2023.  The program's site can be found here: 

https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/graduate-program/computational-linguistics-clasic-ms 

# Programming Languages
I am most comfortable in Python (either as .py or Jupyter Notebooks) and R.  I am also moderately comfortable in Java.  

# Prior Work Experience
## Brandeis
I worked at Brandeis University as part of the AJPP from April 2019 to September 2021 as a Data Scientist/Analyst.  More information about that project can be found here:

https://ajpp.brandeis.edu/

In short, it is an ongoing project that seeks to give accurate, Census-like population estimates yearly or every other year for the Jewish community across the entire United States.  Its purpose is to show that the Jewish community is alive and thriving in the US and to show community leaders where they can and should focus efforts to drive better outreach and engagement.  

## Luminoso Technologies
Before Brandeis, during my undergraduate degree from August 2017 to December 2017, I worked part-time/contractually for Luminoso Technologies.  Their link can be

In short, while they were building their NLP systems, I was tasked with annotation and guiding the team in how they should implement morphological information to make the Japanese sentiment-analysis portions of their system work better.
