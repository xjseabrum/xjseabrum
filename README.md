# Quick Introduction
Hello! My name is Jay Seabrum (Xajavion Seabrum) and I am currently pursuing my Master's 
degree at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

Here on this GitHub you will find some of the projects that I have done either for class or 
on my own free time. Below you will find links to these projects.  Each of the links
will have a README that explains more about the projects contained therein. 

If you have any questions or would like to cite any of the reports found on my GitHub
please contact me at:
